Getting Involved
================

We do our best to make contributing to Ngx CC very easy. If you don't feel that
something is easy, then the easiest thing you can do is bring it up so we're
able to take action.

A short list of ways to get involved:

* If your blog has good quality Nginx topics, add it to :ref:`community-planet`.
* Jump into the :ref:`community-irc` and help answer questions.
* If you know Python, check out `our projects` on github and see if any of it
  looks like something you'd want to contribute to.
* The best way you can help is to contribute high quality documentation. Check
  out the `docs repo`_.

.. _`our projects`: https://github.com/ngx
.. _`docs repo`: https://github.com/ngx/docs

There are other ways to contribute, but this is a list of our "big ticket" items.
